# Fix Port 5173 Conflict - Kill Running Dev Servers

## Issue

The dev servers we just started are still running in the background, occupying ports 5173 and 3000. When you try to run `npm run dev` again, it fails because the ports are already in use.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Stop Running Processes

Kill the processes occupying the ports:

- Port 5173: PID 33032 (Vite frontend server)
- Port 3000: PID 32572 (Next.js backend server)

Commands to execute:

```powershell
Stop-Process -Id 33032 -Force
Stop-Process -Id 32572 -Force
```

### 2. Verify Ports Are Free

Check that ports are no longer in use:

```powershell
netstat -ano | Select-String ":5173|:3000"
```

### 3. Restart Development Servers (Only if needed)

If you want to start fresh dev servers again:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Important Notes

- The dev servers are running in the **background** from our previous fix
- To stop them permanently without restarting, just run step 1
- If you want to keep them running, **don't run `npm run dev` again** - they're already active at:
  - Frontend: `http://localhost:5173/`
  - Backend: `http://localhost:3000`

## Alternative Solution

Instead of killing and restarting, you can simply use the already-running servers. They are fully functional.
